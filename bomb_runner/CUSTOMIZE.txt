GAME DEVELOPED BY CHASE OPSAHL

BOMB_RUNNER.PY CANNOT RUN WITHOUT BOMB_MODULES.PY. THEY MUST BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY.

YOU CAN ADD YOUR OWN MODLES. THEY MUST FIT THIS CRITERIA.

	BOMB_MODULES.PY
		YOU MUST ADD A MODULE_(YOURNUBER) FUNCTION TO BOMB_MODULES.PY

		IF THE BOMB IS DEFUSED, IT MUST RETURN TRUE IN ORDER TO WORK IN THE BOMB_RUNNER.PY

		LIKEWISE, IF THE BOMB BLOWS UP, IT MUST RETURN FALSE

	BOMB_RUNNER.PY
		YOU MUST ADD YOUR MODULE NUMBER TO THE "MODULES" LIST ON LINE 25

		NAVIGATE TO THE DEFUSE_BOMB FUNCTION AND ADD AN ELIF STATEMENT

		THE ELIF STATEMENT MUST LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHERS

		EX.
			elif select_bomb == 5:
			if bm.module_'YOURNUMBER'() == True:
				bombs_defused += 1
				modules.remove(select_bomb)
			else:
				lives -= 1
